I work at the intersection of **AI evaluation**, **prompt engineering**, and **clear technical reasoning**. My background blends hands‑on troubleshooting, structured analysis, and a creative instinct for patterns — the kind that shows up in both good engineering and good storytelling. I build small, focused evaluation samples that demonstrate how large language models behave under pressure: ambiguity, bias, missing information, and constraint.

My approach is methodical, evidence‑driven, and grounded in reproducible workflows. I value clarity, uncertainty‑awareness, and the discipline of testing one variable at a time.

## 🔍 Evaluation Portfolio

These projects form a growing series of targeted evaluations, each designed to isolate a single behavioural dimension of LLMs.

### **1. Hallucination Under Missing Information**

Tests how models respond when key facts are absent or fictional.  
Includes raw outputs, analysis notes, and a concise summary.  
**Repo:** _llm-hallucination-evaluation_

### **2. Directional Bias Under Symmetric Prompts**

Examines whether models drift toward a preferred framing when both sides are balanced.  
**Repo:** _llm-directional-bias-evaluation_

More samples are planned, each small, sharp, and methodologically clean.

## 🧠 How I Work

I design evaluations using:

- **Test matrices** with clear expectations
- **Raw model outputs** stored for transparency
- **Analysis notes** capturing early observations
- **Concise reports** summarising behavioural patterns
- **Reproducible workflows** that others can follow

My goal is to make evaluation understandable, inspectable, and grounded in evidence rather than intuition.

## 🛠 Technical Foundations

I have practical experience with:

- JavaScript fundamentals
- API workflows
- zsh scripting
- Git and reproducible documentation
- Basic security analysis and OSINT tooling
- Model behaviour testing and prompt design

I’m continuously expanding these skills while keeping my focus on clarity and method.

## 🌱 Roadmap

Upcoming evaluation samples:

- Instruction‑following robustness
- Paraphrase consistency
- Safety and refusal behaviour
- Multi‑step reasoning drift

Each will follow the same structure: small, controlled, and easy to inspect.

## ✦ A Note on Identity

The name _Hermeticpoet_ reflects the two halves of my work:  
the **precision of systems** and the **resonance of narrative**.  
Both matter when evaluating models that generate meaning.
