# Kevin Walton — AI Evaluation & Technical Reasoning

I work at the intersection of **AI evaluation**, **prompt engineering**, and **clear technical reasoning**. My background blends hands-on troubleshooting, structured analysis, and a creative instinct for patterns — the kind that shows up in both good engineering and good storytelling.

I build small, focused evaluation samples that demonstrate how large language models behave under pressure: **ambiguity**, **bias**, **missing information**, and **constraint**.

My approach is methodical, evidence-driven, and grounded in reproducible workflows. I value clarity, uncertainty-awareness, and the discipline of testing one variable at a time.

## 🔍 Evaluation Portfolio

These projects form a growing series of targeted evaluations, each designed to isolate a single behavioural dimension of LLMs.

### [llm-hallucination-missing-information](https://github.com/Hermeticpoet/llm-hallucination-missing-information)

Tests how models respond when key facts are absent or fictional.  
Includes raw outputs, analysis notes, and a concise summary.

### [llm-directional-bias-evaluation](https://github.com/Hermeticpoet/llm-directional-bias-evaluation)

Examines whether models drift toward a preferred framing when both sides are balanced.  
Uses symmetric prompt testing and structured comparisons.

More samples are planned — each small, sharp, and methodologically clean.

## 🧠 How I Work

I design evaluations using:

- ✅ Test matrices with clear expectations
- 📂 Raw model outputs stored for transparency
- 📝 Analysis notes capturing early observations
- 📊 Concise reports summarising behavioural patterns
- 🔁 Reproducible workflows that others can follow

My goal is to make evaluation **understandable**, **inspectable**, and **grounded in evidence** rather than intuition.

## 🛠 Technical Foundations

I have practical experience with:

- JavaScript fundamentals
- API workflows
- zsh scripting
- Git and reproducible documentation
- Basic security analysis and OSINT tooling
- Model behaviour testing and prompt design

I’m continuously expanding these skills while keeping my focus on clarity and method.

## 🌱 Roadmap

Upcoming evaluation samples:

- Instruction-following robustness
- Paraphrase consistency
- Safety and refusal behaviour
- Multi-step reasoning drift

Each will follow the same structure: **small**, **controlled**, and **easy to inspect**.

## ✦ A Note on Identity

The name **Hermeticpoet** reflects the two halves of my work:  
the **precision of systems** and the **resonance of narrative**.  
Both matter when evaluating models that generate meaning.
